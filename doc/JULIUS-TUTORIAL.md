# Julius EDSL Turorial

## Introduction
__Julius__ is an *Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL)* for ETL/ELT data processing in Haskell.  Julius enables us to express complex data transformation flows (i.e., an arbitrary combination of ETL operations) in a more friendly manner (a __Julius Expression__), with plain Haskell code (no special language for ETL scripting required).
In this tutorial, we will show the basics of Julius in order to help someone to get started.
